Java_Programs
=============


Just some Simple Java programs that I have coded for class, work, etc.


<u><h3>Dice, Pi, and Primes</h3></u>
<b>Dice:</b> Randomly generated Dice machine. Rolls two dice at a time. You just input how many instances you would like to roll.<br/>

<b>Pi:</b> Takes an integer input of "Terms" to approximate Pi. Uses <code>pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ... </code> as the premise for "terms".<br/>

<b>Primes:</b> This program shows a Listing of Prime numbers from 2 up to the Integer Input that you give. There is also a public function that returns true if the number input is prime or false otherwise.


<u><h3>Fraction and IntegerSet</h3></u>

<b>Fraction:</b> A classic Class definition of a Fraction. This is an Object Oriented way of defining fraction, partially given by our teacher and updated by me. I added simple arithmetic functions such as: simplify(), add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(). The "toString()" class is also overrided so that you can print out Fractions with ease.<br/>

<b>IntegerSet:</b> IntegerSet is used to hold array Sets of 0 - 100. They also have additional functions for the set theoretical union and intersect. It also has an isEqualTo() function for declaring equal sets and finally a toString() "overrided" as well.<br/>

<b>DriverForFracIntegerSet.jar:</b> Includes an executable Jar file with a driver for Fraction and IntegerSet classes.
